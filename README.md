# ECE345 Algorithms and Data Structures

This course covered the following topics (in order of class schedule): asymptotics (Big Oh/Omega/Sigma), logarithms, induction/contradiction, recurrences, permutations and combinations, probability, heaps, heapsort, quicksort, counting sort, radix sort, selection sort, binary search trees (BSTs), red black trees, hash tables, hashing, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, amortized analysis, splay trees, graph algorithms, minimum spanning trees, shortest paths, maximum flow, history of computing (Turing machines), and NP-completeness.

The algorithms for the code in this repository were implemented using algorithms taught in lectures, and from the course textbook *Introduction to Algorithms* (CLRS). These references are formally listed below (credits to these references where due). I implemented the code in this repository to gain a better understanding of the concepts taught in class.  
  
(My lecture notes can also be found in this repository).
